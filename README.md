# Explore Washington D.C. Bike Rental Dataset

## Overview
This project analyzes the **Washington D.C. Bike Rental Dataset**, exploring trends in bike usage, seasonal variations, and the impact of external factors like weather and holidays. The analysis leverages Python-based data science libraries and follows a structured data analysis approach.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical data on bike rentals in Washington D.C., including information such as:
- Date and time of rental
- Number of rentals
- Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.)
- Holiday and working day indicators
- Seasonal attributes

## Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations in the data.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and transform variables if necessary.
3. **Visualization:** Use plots and graphs to present insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas**: Data processing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning modeling (if applied)
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive data exploration

## Installation & Usage
